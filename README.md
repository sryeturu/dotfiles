# dots
Hi there! In this repository, you'll find my dotfiles and other stuff related to theming and customization for my current setup on Arch with i3.

The design and color schemes for this setup were inspired by the wallpaper choice, "Let's Go Home," created by the artist [SeerLight](https://linktr.ee/seerlight).
Many of the elements here are modifications or tweaks of others' configs. I've tried to document these in the comments.
